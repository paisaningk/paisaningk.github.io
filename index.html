            Hello, my name is Paisan Ingkavara. I worked at Sunny Syrup Studio for two years and had the opportunity to
            intern at Urnique Studio. I am interested in developing tools to reduce repetitive tasks for the team. In my
            free time, I enjoy learning new things to continuously develop my skills for future growth.

                <p>
                    Not Monday Cafe is an idle game similar to Rusty's Retirement, developed using Unity. The game
                    focuses on idle mechanics, offering a relaxing experience for players.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this project, I was responsible for developing game systems and designing a framework for a
                    grid-based game, as well as creating tools to support the project’s development workflow.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Developed a grid system that divides the game area into small squares for object placement and
                        character movement. This system also connects various game mechanics, like defining areas for
                        furniture placement or walkable paths for characters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developed a tile map system and tools for creating tiles to display walls and floors within the
                        game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developed a furniture creation system with modular sub-systems to easily add new features
                        without modifying the core system
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developed a furniture framework, including sprite rendering, size customization, and AI
                        interaction points.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developed a save/load system that stores in-game data for convenience in creating mockups or
                        trailers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developed an animation system using the Sprite Library to simplify repetitive animations and
                        created tools for building sprite libraries for in-game characters
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developed a UI framework, including buttons that trigger selectable sound effects on click and
                        play effects when hovered over or clicked
                    </li>

                    Spirit Mancer is a 2D Action Hack-and-Slash game with Deckbuilding mechanics, developed using Unity.
                    The game won Play Prime’s Best Game of the Year award and was selected to compete in the LEVEL UP KL
                    SEA Game Awards 2024
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this project, I was responsible for developing game systems, tools, and optimizing the game for
                    porting to PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch platforms. Additionally, I supported the team with
                    bug fixes
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Optimized resource usage by developing a load-on-demand system and reducing loading delays
                        through asynchronous loading. This ensured efficient game performance across PC, PlayStation,
                        and Nintendo Switch platforms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developed a key binding system and a UI display system to support customizable controls on PC,
                        PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Integrated various third-party systems into the project, such as Wwise for audio management and
                        a localization system for multi-language support.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developed tools for managing sprites within the game, such as automating the movement of sprite
                        files to the correct folders and configuring the sprites to meet the standards set by the art
                        team
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developed tools for creating cutscenes, such as controlling animations in different scenes and
                        displaying localized text based on the player's selected language.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developed a build tool that allows users to select the type of build, such as Demo, Full Game,
                        or Test version. Additionally, the tool enables users to define the Addressable assets to
                        include in the game, helping to reduce the game's file size.
